this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: N/A (GitHub Codespaces and GitPod workspaces each require an extension)\r\n\r\n- VS Code Version: 1.78.2\r\n- OS Version: macOS Ventura 13.4\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a GitHub Codespace or a GitPod workspace in VS Code for macOS.\r\n2. Open a file for editing, or run run a `git` operation that waits on file edit (like `git commit`), and make any edit to the file.\r\n3. Press ⌘S followed by ⌘W (or correspondingly on non-macOS platforms).\r\n\r\nExpected: The file is saved and then closed.\r\nObserved: VS Code warns that \"Your changes will be lost if you don't save them.\"\r\n\r\n<img width=\"276\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-30 at 21 18 32\" src=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/assets/248078/a39ab20d-33aa-4d75-b2ff-a63e047d1da2\">\r\n\r\nWhen using `git`, it's extremely common to save a file and then follow that by immediately closing it. This means that I run into a spurious warning many times a day. I don't recall any instance where the file was *not* actually in the process of a successful save by the time the warning pops up.\r\n\r\nI assume that this issue occurs because the round-trip to confirm the save is not fast enough when using a codespace/workspace, compared to a typical local file save.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to fix this by doing one of the following?\r\n\r\n- Avoid showing the warning if a file save request was just issued.\r\n  - Maybe show a warning if it turns out the save failed?\r\n- Introduce an action for \"save and close\".\r\n  - Possibly with a default chorded shortcut of ⌘S ⌘W?\r\n\r\nApologies if this is a duplicate issue, or in the wrong repo. I've been experiencing this issue for a long time (a year or two), but I haven't seen other issues for it yet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183897/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183893","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183893/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183893/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183893/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/183893","id":1733327564,"node_id":"I_kwDOAn8RLM5nUHrM","number":183893,"title":"Expose a way for an extension/webview access to the file icon theme","user":{"login":"eamodio","id":641685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTY4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio","html_url":"https://github.com/eamodio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-05-31T03:32:37Z","updated_at":"2023-05-31T04:05:49Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Treeview's can use the `resourceUri` property on an item to have VS Code provide the appropriate themed file icon, but there is no way outside of that for an extension to get access to the appropriate icon for a `Uri`, ideally for use in a webview.\r\n\r\nHere is our example use-case.

Install any one of various status bar extensions (Bottom Terminal, Activitus Bar, Workspace Name in Status Bar, et cetera)...\r\n2. Status bar is consistent across restarts & reloading of windows.\r\n3. After connecting to remote machine, status bar seems randomly to ignore certain extensions. This is inconsistent across restarts & reloading of windows. When hiding / showing certain status bar items, others seem to appear.\r\n5. Uninstalling & reinstalling vscode-server-insiders on the Host machine does not resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else seen this? Again, this does not seem to be an issue with any one particular extension, but with vscode-server-insiders itself. Also noteworthy is that the instability does not occur in any way with vscode-server stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183860","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183860/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183860/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183860/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/183860","id":1732834854,"node_id":"I_kwDOAn8RLM5nSPYm","number":183860,"title":"Paste as doesn't offer relative path on external files","user":{"login":"lramos15","id":4544166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDQxNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4544166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15","html_url":"https://github.com/lramos15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lramos15/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODk0MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/labels/info-needed","name":"info-needed","color":"E2A1C2","default":false,"description":"Issue requires more information from poster"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIxOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2023-05-30T19:15:15Z","updated_at":"2023-05-30T21:42:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Testing #183681\r\n\r\nWhen copy and pasting a file from within the workspace I'm offered an absolute and relative path as a paste option.

#179213 \r\n\r\n- [ ] anyOS @jrieken \r\n- [x] anyOS @ulugbekna \r\n\r\nComplexity: 3\r\n\r\n--- \r\n## Summary:\r\n\r\nNotebooks now support CodeActions being run upon save. One extra CodeActionKind has been introduced for CodeActions that apply to the entire scope of the notebook, editing multiple cells (i.e., extracting imports to a top cell, grouping %pip install's, etc.). Source level CodeActions are also supported on an individual cell level. These run in parallel so they are restricted to only editing the resource that is passed to it (the TextDocument of the cell the provider is called upon).\r\n\r\nFor Notebook Level CodeActions, the provider is only passed the FIRST cell of the notebook, as to not return CodeActions that need to resolve for each cell. Keep this in mind if you choose to create your own provider/action.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Test:\r\n\r\n**note: testing Notebook level CodeActions will require OSS, or tomorrow's (05/31) insiders build\r\n\r\n- Download or create your own extension, creating a provider for both cell/source and Notebook CodeActions\r\n  - [This](https://github.com/Yoyokrazy/clean-nb-imports-ext) is a sample extension that has the two providers\r\n- Launch the extension host \r\n- Create a new or open a pre-existing notebook\r\n  - [This](https://github.com/Yoyokrazy/ipynb-playground) is a playground I use with a couple messy notebooks that can be tested on.\r\n- Go to Settings (UI) and search for `notebook.codeActionsOnSave`, and add your CodeActions.\r\n  - If you use the sample extension, your settings.json should include something like this to test both Cell and Notebook levels:\r\n```json\r\n\"notebook.codeActionsOnSave\": {\r\n\t\"notebook.cleanImports\": true,\r\n\t\"source.fixAll\": true,\r\n},\r\n```\r\n- Save the document, triggering the CodeActions. May be easier to ensure they work individually by commenting one or the other CodeAction within your settings, then testing them combined at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Things to check\r\n- CodeActions are applied correctly, the changes desired are applied without error. \r\n- The notebook is clean and saved after all CodeActions are applied.\r\n\r\n## If you want to do more\r\n- Create a source level CodeAction that applies edit to multiple cells. This should FAIL and not apply, due to the restriction of only editing the given cell/resource\r\n\r\n--- \r\nThanks so much for testing!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183855/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183854","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183854/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183854/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/183854/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/183854","id":1732777068,"node_id":"I_kwDOAn8RLM5nSBRs","number":183854,"title":"switching
